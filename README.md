# SD_Bakery_Store
Josh is a recent college graduate who is looking for places in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic to open a new bakery store. He already has the employees and resources necessary to open the business, but he needs to determine where exactly is the best place (neighborhood) to open it.  

In Santo Domingo, there are many bakery stores in every neighborhood, so it is necessary to choose the best place in order to maximize customer flow and profits. He knows the competition is rough, but also there are many bakery stores who open and stay in business successfully. Nevertheless, others donâ€™t have the same fate and close in just months. Josh needs to be presented a model to determine where is the best place where he can find success.
